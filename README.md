## ðŸ“Š Data Analytics Projects â€“ Coming Soon!

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

This repository is currently a preview. I will soon be uploading a collection of data analytics projects that showcase my skills in data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and storytelling. 

These projects will involve tools and technologies such as: 
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.) . SOL (for querying and transforming structured data) 
* Power Bl (interactive dashboards and reports) 
* Excel (data manipulation and visualization) 
* Other relevant tools used in the data analytics workflow
  
If you're visiting from my portfolio, this space is actively under development stay tuned as I build and upload real-world projects demonstrating my end-to-end analytics capabilities.

Thanks for stopping by!
